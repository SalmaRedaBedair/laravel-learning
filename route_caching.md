# Route caching 
Route caching is a performance optimization feature in Laravel that significantly improves the speed of your application by reducing the time it takes to register and resolve routes. This feature is particularly beneficial for applications with a large number of routes.

When you define routes in Laravel, whether in the `routes/web.php` file or the `routes/api.php` file, Laravel needs to read and interpret these route definitions for each incoming request. This process involves parsing the route files, registering routes, and matching the requested URI against registered routes to determine which controller or closure should handle the request.

Route caching, as the name suggests, involves caching the route information so that Laravel doesn't need to re-parse and register routes on every request. Instead, it can quickly look up the route information from the cache, resulting in a significant performance boost.

Here's a general overview of how route caching works:

1. **Route Registration**: When your Laravel application starts or when you run specific commands like `php artisan route:cache`, Laravel reads your route files and registers the routes.

2. **Caching Routes**: After registering the routes, Laravel caches the route information, including the route URIs, methods, and associated controllers or closures, into a cached file.

3. **Subsequent Requests**: In subsequent requests, Laravel checks if the route cache file exists. If it does, Laravel uses the cached route information instead of re-reading and parsing the route files.


## closure function affect perfromance
Using route closures in your routes (e.g., defining routes using anonymous functions) can prevent Laravel from being able to cache the routes effectively. This is because closures are PHP anonymous functions, and they cannot be serialized for caching purposes. Therefore, applications that heavily rely on route closures may miss out on the performance benefits of route caching.

To take full advantage of route caching, it's recommended to use controller methods instead of closures for handling routes whenever possible. Controllers can be serialized, allowing Laravel to cache the route information efficiently.

To cache your routes, you can use the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan route:cache
```

And to clear the route cache, you can use:

```bash
php artisan route:clear
```

Keep in mind that if you make changes to your routes, you'll need to clear the route cache so that Laravel can re-cache the updated route information.
